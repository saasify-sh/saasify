# 5 Minute Quick Start

This guide will give you an overview of how Saasify works by creating an example SaaS product.

The result will be a live SaaS product that anyone can sign up and pay for.

## Getting Started

First you'll need to install the Saasify CLI ([open source](https://github.com/saasify-sh/saasify/tree/master/packages/saasify-cli ':target=_blank')).

```bash
npm install -g saasify
```

You can check out the available commands via `saasify --help` and run `saasify help <cmd>` to view the sub-help for any given command.

You'll need to create a Saasify account to get started, which will authenticate with GitHub by default.

```bash
saasify signup
```

## Creating a Project

You can use the `saasify init` command to bootstrap a new project.

```bash
saasify init [project-name]
```

**You'll want to choose the default template called "minimal".**

> The rest of this tutorial will use `quick-start` as the project name. Project names cannot contain underscores or special characters.

This will create a new folder containing `saasify.json` and `readme.md` files. Your saasify.json will look like this:

_(saasify.json)_

```json
{
  "name": "quick-start",
  "description": "Minimal starter template that saasifies an externally hosted backend API.",
  "backendUrl": "https://httpbin.org"
}
```

This template "saasifies" an example REST API pointing to [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org ':target=_blank').

Saasify acts as a proxy in front of this API to handle auth, billing, rate limiting, etc. This allows your backend API to focus solely on your product's unique value proposition.

You'll eventually want to replace this `backendUrl` with a URL pointing to your SaaS product's externally hosted backend API.

_Note that an OpenAPI spec is no longer required to use Saasify_. Including an OpenAPI spec that describes your backend API allows Saasify to auto-generate API docs for your product. It also allows Saasify to perform additional validation as it proxies HTTP calls to your backend API. If this use case interests you, check out our [OpenAPI](./openapi.md) docs to learn more.

## Deploying your Project

You can deploy your project by running `saasify deploy` from within the directory containing your project's `saasify.json`.

```bash
saasify deploy
```

This creates a new deployment for your project with two key features:

- An API proxied via our API gateway. For example, `https://ssfy.sh/username/projectName@deploymentHash` ([live example](https://ssfy.sh/dev/quick-start@03b0125f/get ':target=_blank'))
- A publicly accessible SaaS website for your product. For example, `https://username_projectName_deploymentHash.saasify.sh` ([live example](https://dev_quick-start_03b0125f.saasify.sh ':target=_blank'))

The SaaS website's URL will be copied to your clipboard so you can check it out live in your browser.

Deployments are immutable and represented by a unique hash (`03b0125f` in this example). Every time you make a change to your SaaS product and run `saasify deploy`, you'll get a new unique preview URL.

Deployments are really lightweight -- you can create as many deployments as you want.

!> Note that even though this website is public, your customers won't be able to sign up and pay for your new SaaS product until you `publish` a version to production. We'll get to this step shortly.

## Testing your API

You can test out your SaaS API on this live deployment via any HTTP framework.

```bash
curl https://ssfy.sh/dev/quick-start@03b0125f/get
```

You'll need to change the URL suffix in the example below to the `url` from your deployment. The username (`dev`), project name (`quick-start`), and hash (`03b0125f`) may be different, but the structure will be the same.

This HTTP GET request should return a JSON payload containing all of the headers that were sent to the downstream `httpbin` endpoint from Saasify's API gateway:

```json
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)",
    "X-Saasify-Proxy-Secret": "..."
  },
  "origin": "...",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

Saasify's API gateway adds some powerful functionality to your downstream API:

- **User authentication**
  - Your customers can add a standard `Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}` header to these requests once they've signed up for your product.
  - Your API endpoints will receive `x-saasify-user` and `x-saasify-plan` headers for authenticated requests.
- **Customizable rate limiting**
  - Based on IP address for unauthenticated requests.
  - Based on customer ID for authenticated requests.
- **Usage tracking & analytics**
  - All API calls are recorded for fine-grained analytics.
  - This is particularly useful for _metered billing_ where you want to charge customers based on the number of requests they make.
- **Global caching**
  - Via custom Cloudflare edge workers.
- **Auto-generated docs**
  - Including example code snippets for many common languages.

## Publishing your Deployment

Once you're happy with your project, it's time to publish it live which will enable your customers to start paying for your product.

```bash
saasify publish
```

This will prompt you for a version number following [semver](https://semver.org ':target=_blank') format. Version numbers must increase with each published version, and changes to pricing should result in a major version update.

Once published, your auto-generated SaaS web client will be available at `https://<username>_<project-name>.saasify.sh`. For example, [https://dev_imagemin.saasify.sh](https://dev_imagemin.saasify.sh).

If you want to alias your product to an external domain via DNS, we'd be happy to help you set this up. Please [contact support](support.md) to enable this feature for your project.
